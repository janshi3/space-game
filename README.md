 My first game made with Unity. It's a game where you have to capture enemy planets while defending your own. Planets spawn ships and allow you to heal. Allied ships will fight with you. Power-ups are in development. One power-up is added, that drops from generals or asteroids. It will attract nearby ships from one of the teams. The only unique ship type right now is general. Generals will recruit nearby ships, and lead massive attacks on enemy planets. A main menu is added but not finished yet. You can play the game at: https://janshi.itch.io/space-conquerors
